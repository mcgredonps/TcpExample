## Example Code

This is referred to in the Open-Dis wiki over in 
https://github.com/open-dis/DISTutorial . Don't
delete it.

This is some TCP example code that is about as simple as it
can get. It shows a client connecting to a server on a TCP
connection, then receiving a message from the server. Then
the connection drops.

There are two NetBeans projects here. Start Netbeans then open
both the projects TcpThreadServer and TcpClient. You should run
TcpThreadServer first, then execute TcpClient.
